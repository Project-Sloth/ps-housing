# ps-housing

ps-housing is a resource that opens up a world of creative possibilities for housing. Its user-friendly interface lets you decorate any location to your heart's content. The best part? Not only is it completely free, but it's also reliable and functional, unlike many other housing systems available. Dive in and start transforming spaces with ps-housing today!

- Players can decorate their houses and apartments with a full selection of furniture and decorations (included a wide variety of custom housing props)
- Provides support for housing and apartments and is a replacement for qb-apartments and qb-housing
- Allows players to purchase and list houses for sale through `bl-realtor`
- Houses come with personal garages
- Houses and apartments come with personal wardrobes and stashes
- Players can share keys to their houses and apartments with other players


ps-housing owes its existence to the exceptional coding expertise of [Xirvin#0985](https://github.com/ImXirvin). His application of top-tier coding practices has been instrumental in creating this script. We at Project Sloth are thrilled that he has joined our team and utilized our platform to deliver this incredible, much-anticipated resource. Our sincere appreciation goes out to [Xirvin#0985](https://github.com/ImXirvin) for his outstanding contribution!

# ISSUES?

- SPawning in on existing character, stuck at spinning black screen
- ensure ox_lib is at the top of the server cfg
- once player spawns they need to be told what to do to customize apartment
- qb-radialmenu remove qb-housing related options / replace with ps-housing options??
- need to add a help menu that explains
- double notification when purchase stuff (gives ox lib notification and qb - should only use which framework is selected)
- furntiure purchaser should check cash or bank
- exiting freecam back to player via esc does some derpy camera flying in thingy
- boguht furniture, then confirmed purchase,reopened adn bought more furntiure and it delted my existing furniture (left apt and came back no furniture)
- add manage access menu for who has access to your house and can put things down etc
- double blips on each apartment

Players need to place their [stash](https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-housing/blob/7efd2009050b9a20969877cf69b284352a9309bf/shared/config.lua#LL426C96-L426C96) and [wardrobe](https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-housing/blob/7efd2009050b9a20969877cf69b284352a9309bf/shared/config.lua#L427) or else they wont have one. Check [Config](https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-housing/blob/7efd2009050b9a20969877cf69b284352a9309bf/shared/config.lua#L422) for more information.

# Installation 
1. Insert the following event towards the end of qb-multicharacters > client > main.lua 

```lua
RegisterNetEvent("qb-multicharacter:client:destroyCam", function ()
    SetCamActive(cam, false)
    DestroyCam(cam, true)
    RenderScriptCams(false, false, 1, true, true)
end)
```

2. Find the following events in `qb-multicharacter` and change in server/main.lua event to: 

`qb-multicharacter > server > main.lua`
```lua
RegisterNetEvent('qb-multicharacter:server:loadUserData', function(cData)
    local src = source
    if QBCore.Player.Login(src, cData.citizenid) then
        repeat
            Wait(10)
        until hasDonePreloading[src]
        print('^2[qb-core]^7 '..GetPlayerName(src)..' (Citizen ID: '..cData.citizenid..') has succesfully loaded!')
        QBCore.Commands.Refresh(src)
        TriggerClientEvent('ps-housing:client:setupSpawnUI', src, cData)
        TriggerEvent("qb-log:server:CreateLog", "joinleave", "Loaded", "green", "**".. GetPlayerName(src) .. "** (<@"..(QBCore.Functions.GetIdentifier(src, 'discord'):gsub("discord:", "") or "unknown").."> |  ||"  ..(QBCore.Functions.GetIdentifier(src, 'ip') or 'undefined') ..  "|| | " ..(QBCore.Functions.GetIdentifier(src, 'license') or 'undefined') .." | " ..cData.citizenid.." | "..src..") loaded..")
    end
end)
```

`qb-multicharacter > server > main.lua`
```lua
RegisterNetEvent('qb-multicharacter:server:createCharacter', function(data)
    local src = source
    local newData = {}
    newData.cid = data.cid
    newData.charinfo = data
    if QBCore.Player.Login(src, false, newData) then
        repeat
            Wait(10)
        until hasDonePreloading[src]
        print('^2[qb-core]^7 '..GetPlayerName(src)..' has succesfully loaded!')
        QBCore.Commands.Refresh(src)
        TriggerClientEvent("qb-multicharacter:client:closeNUI", src)
        newData.citizenid = QBCore.Functions.GetPlayer(src).PlayerData.citizenid
        TriggerClientEvent('ps-housing:client:setupSpawnUI', src, newData)
        GiveStarterItems(src)
    end
end)
```
3. Find the following events in `qb-spawn` and change in client/client.lua event to: 

`qb-spawn > client.lua > line 51 > 'qb-spawn:client:setupSpawns' event`
```lua
RegisterNetEvent('qb-spawn:client:setupSpawns', function(cData, new, apps)
    if not new then
        QBCore.Functions.TriggerCallback('qb-spawn:server:getOwnedHouses', function(houses)
            local myHouses = {}
            if houses ~= nil then
                for i = 1, (#houses), 1 do
                    local house = houses[i]
                    myHouses[#myHouses+1] = {
                        house = house,
                        label = house.label,
                    }
                end
            end

            locations = apps,

        })
    end
end)
```

4. Run the `properties.sql` file, but be cautious. If a table named `properties` already exists in your database, this operation will drop it, resulting in the loss of all its data.
5. Delete default [qb-apartments](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-apartments)
6. Delete default [qb-houses](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-houses)
7. Delete `qb-apartments/config.lua` references in both `qb-spawn` and `qb-multicharacter` fxmanifest.lua (and any other scripts that may reference it).
8. Install the dependencies below.
9. In your server.cfg, add `ensure ox_lib` above all other resources

# To Do
- Optimise RAM Usage
    - Callback the stuff needed only when entering the property. (like furniture).
